            <div class="intro">
                <p>I am a student styding Engineering Science at the university of Toronto in Canada. I want to persue either robotics or A.I in my upper year studies. I also wish to explore the tech world in the future by building technology projects and self-studying important tools for me to accomplish this goal. </p>
                <p>I am a curious, adventurous, and enthusiastic student engineer, who values creativity, rigour, and diversity in life and the process of engineering design. I developed a strong interest in engineering at a very young age through cars. I was fascinated by how all the complicated components work in harmony. </p>

                <h1>Skills</h1>
                
                <h2>1. Python:</h2>
                <p>I learned python through out high school and I am still learning this lanuage in university. I created many projects and assignments using this coding lanuage. I also learned A.I through this lanuage.</p>

                <h2>2. C:</h2>
                <p>I learned C lanuage from a university course. I completed many assignments using this lanuage. Some of the projects in C will be displaced at the project section.</p>

                <h2>3. Java:</h2>
                <p>I started to learn Java since grade 9, and I haved used this lanuage to compete in the Canadian Computing Contest.</p>

                <h2>4. HTML and CSS:</h2>
                <p>I self-learned these two lanuages. I first interacted with these two lanuages during my internship at UBTech. I then self-learned more of these lanuages during summer breaks.</p>
                
                <h1>Abilities</h1>
        
                <h2>1. Leadership:</h2>
                <p>I practiced this skills during SHAD Waterloo in 2019. I have also improved this skill by leading my high school robotics team as the team captain</p>
                
                <h2>2. Teamwork:</h2>
                <p>I devloped this skills during my time as the robotics team captain, as I had to cooperate with other teammates to achieve the goals. I also practice this important skill everyday as I have to work with a team for one of the univeristy courses.</p>

                <h2>3. Self-learning:</h2>
                <p>I have this ability since a very long time. However, I improved this ability by a large margin during university. I have to learn most course materials by myself. I also self-learned HTML and CSS, and I made this website thorugh self-learning by watching youtube and surfing the internet.</p>

                <span class="line2"></span>
                <p>I am interested in robotics since a very young age.To gain more knowledge about this interesting field, I attended robotics lessons outside of school at a very young age. I started by building Lego projects and programming them using Scratch, a block-based visual programming language.</p>

                <h2>2. Electric cars / Racing</h2>
                <span class="line2"></span>
                <p>I am interested in cars when I was little, and it was the main reason for me to pursue engineering. I was fansanated by all the working parts that make up a car. As time progress, I am now also interested in the field of new power source cars. Apart from the engineering side, I also enjoy watching racing. (F1 GP is my favourite)</p>

                <p>I am interested in sports and like to excercise. Tennis is my favourite sport, and I have won mutliple medals in tennis competitions. (gold metal for my high school) I also enjoy other sports such as golf, soccer, and basketball. I would love to learn more sports such as surfing and volleyball.</p>

                <p>I am fansanated by the power of A.I. There are endless possibilites when A.I is used. I have already learned some basics of A.I. For example, backtracking and gradient decent. I am also planning to explore A.I on my own apart from the univeristy courses.</p>
